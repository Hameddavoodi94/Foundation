# Theoretical foundations:

This repository contains simple python examples that cover a wide range of topics and methodologies in Statistics, Math, and Econometrics. 

I used Numpy arrays since the operations are faster and more compact than Python lists. NumPy uses much less memory to store data and it provides a mechanism of specifying the data types.
