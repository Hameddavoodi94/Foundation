## Introduction:

Probability theory and statistical inference are fundamental concepts in mathematics and statistics that have numerous applications in various fields, such as science, engineering, business, and finance. 
In this README, we will discuss the importance of probability, distributions, random variables, and statistical inference, including expected values, variance, covariance, and confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for mean.

### Probability:
Probability is the study of chance or likelihood. It is a branch of mathematics that deals with the analysis of random phenomena. Probability theory is used to model and analyze complex systems in various fields, such as physics, economics, and biology. The concept of probability is crucial in understanding many statistical methods, such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.

### Probability Distributions:
Probability distributions are mathematical functions that describe the likelihood of different outcomes in a random event. The two main types of probability distributions are continuous and discrete distributions. Continuous distributions are used to model continuous data, while discrete distributions are used to model discrete data. Probability distributions play a critical role in statistical inference, as they provide a way to model the behavior of random variables.

### Random Variables:
A random variable is a variable whose value is determined by the outcome of a random event. Random variables can be either continuous or discrete. In probability theory and statistics, random variables are used to model and analyze the behavior of complex systems.

### Expected Values, Variance, and Covariance:
Expected value, variance, and covariance are important concepts in probability theory and statistics. The expected value is the average value of a random variable. The variance measures how spread out the values of a random variable are from the expected value. The covariance measures the degree to which two random variables are related to each other. These concepts are used to analyze and model the behavior of complex systems and to make predictions about future outcomes.

### Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Tests for Mean:
Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for mean are statistical methods used to make inferences about the population mean based on a sample of data. A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the population mean with a certain degree of confidence. Hypothesis testing is a method used to determine whether a hypothesis about the population mean is supported by the data. These methods are important in many fields, such as medicine, finance, and engineering, where it is essential to make accurate predictions and decisions based on limited data.
