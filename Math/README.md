### Mathematics:

Matrix, solutions, and eigens are all essential concepts in linear algebra, which is a crucial field in data science.
Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers that can be used to represent data sets, with each element in the matrix representing a single data point.
Solutions in linear algebra refer to finding the values of the variables in a system of linear equations that satisfy all the equations simultaneously.
This is important in data science, where linear models are often used to represent and analyze data.
Eigens are a way of describing the characteristics of a matrix, and they are often used in dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis.
By finding the eigens of a matrix, we can identify the most important features of the data and reduce its complexity, making it easier to work with and analyze
