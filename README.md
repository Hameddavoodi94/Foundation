**Theoritical Study cases:**

Welcome to this repository containing case studies in statistics, math, and econometrics. 

Here, you will find a collection of real-world examples and problems that illustrate the application of statistical, mathematical, and econometrics methods in solving practical issues.

The case studies in this repository are organized into three categories: statistics, math, and econometrics. 

Each category contains several case studies that cover a wide range of topics and methodologies.

We mainly going to use libraries like NUMPY since NumPy operations are faster and more compact than Python lists. 

An array consumes less memory and is convenient to use. NumPy uses much less memory to store data and it provides a mechanism of specifying the data types.
